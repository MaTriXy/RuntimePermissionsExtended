# DEPRECATED

# RuntimePermissionsExtended 

[![Android Weekly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Weekly-260-blue.svg)](http://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-260)

This project provides Kotlin extension functions that make permission handling easier and more concise.
These extensions provide same implementation for permission handling in both *Activities* and *Fragments*.

## Usage

All system permissions are annotated in *[AppPermission](https://github.com/Vuksa/KotlinoidRuntimePermission/blob/master/library/src/main/kotlin/com/techwolf/android/permissionhandler/AppPermission.kt)* class.

AppPermission class preview:
```kotlin
sealed class AppPermission(val permissionName: String,
                         val requestCode: Int,
                         val deniedMessageId: Int,
                         val explanationMessageId: Int) {
    
    object CAMERA:  AppPermission(permissionName = Manifest.permission.CAMERA, 
    requestCode = 1, 
    deniedMessageId = R.string.permission_camera_denied, 
    explanationMessageId = R.string.permission_camera_explanation)
    /** 
    * other permissions
    **/
}

```

**`AppPermission`** class properties:
* _`permissionName`_ - system permission that you want to request (string value)
* _`requestCode`_ - *unique* requestCode for permission request (int value)
* _`deniedMessageId`_ - string resource id of message that should be shown to user if permission is denied
* _`explanationMessageId`_ - string resource id of message that should be shown to user if rationale 
permission explanation is needed

>Note: If you want to use certain permission, you can do that by annotating **`AppPermision.{PERMISSION NAME}`**

### Step 0: Prepare AndroidManifest

Add the following line to AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

### Step 1: Request permission by calling *[handlePermission](https://github.com/Vuksa/KotlinoidRuntimePermission/blob/master/library/src/main/kotlin/com/techwolf/android/permissionhandler/PermissionHandler.kt#L61)* function

In Activity or Fragment where you want to perform operation that needs system permission use 
`handlePermission` function as in example bellow:

Example - requesting camera permission:
```kotlin
fun captureCameraImage(){
        handlePermission(AppPermission.CAMERA_PERMISSION,
            onGranted = {
                 /** Permission is granted and we can use camera*inte */
                 openCameraPreviewScreen()
            },
            onDenied = {
                /** Permission is not granted - we should request permission **/      
                requestPermission(it)
            },
            onExplanationNeeded = {
                /** Additional explanation for permission usage needed **/
                snackbarWithAction(it.explanationMessageId) {
                    requestPermission(it)
                }
            })
}
```

`handlePermission` function signature:
```kotlin
fun handlePermission(permission: AppPermission, 
                     onGranted: (AppPermission) -> Unit, 
                     onDenied: (AppPermission) -> Unit,
                     onExplanationNeeded: (AppPermission) -> Unit)
```

**`handlePermission`** function parameters:
* *`AppPermission`* - permission for which we are creating request (e.g AppPermission.CAMERA_PERMISSION)
* *`onGranted`* - lambda block that will be executed if permission is granted.
* *`onDenied`* - lambda block that will be executed if permission is not granted.
* *`onExplanationNeeded`* - lambda block that will be executed if additional explanation for permission is needed.


>Note: In every permission request callback block you can access instance of requested AppPermission via Kotlin keyword ''**it**'' (implicit name of a single parameter).

### Step 2: Handle *`onRequestPermissionResult`* callback

In Activity or Fragment where you need CAMERA permission you should override `onRequestPermissionsResult` function and delegate its parameters
to [onRequestPermissionsResultReceived](https://github.com/Vuksa/KotlinoidRuntimePermission/blob/master/library/src/main/kotlin/com/techwolf/android/permissionhandler/PermissionHandler.kt#L75) extension functions as in example bellow:

```kotlin
    override fun onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode: Int, permissions: Array<out String>, grantResults: IntArray) {
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults)
        onRequestPermissionsResultReceived(requestCode, permissions, grantResults,
                onPermissionGranted = {
                    /** start camera preview **/
                     openCameraPreviewScreen()
                },
                onPermissionDenied = {
                    /** show message that permission is denied**/
                    snackbarWithoutAction(it.deniedMessageId)
                }
        )
    }
```

**`onRequestPermissionsResultReceived`** function signature:
```kotlin
fun onRequestPermissionsResultReceived(requestCode: Int, permissions: Array<out String>,
                                       grantResults: IntArray,
                                       onPermissionGranted: (AppPermission) -> Unit, 
                                       onPermissionDenied: (AppPermission) -> Unit)
```

**`onRequestPermissionsResultReceived`** function parameters: 
* *`requestCode`* - the request code passed in requestPermission(Int) call.
* *`permissions`* - the requested permissions. Never null.
* *`grantResults`* - the grant results for the corresponding permissions.
* *`onPermissionGranted`* - lambda block that will be executed if permission is granted.
* *`onPermissionDenied`* - lambda block that will be executed if permission is denied.


>**Important Note:** Currently, these permission extensions are only able to handle one permission request at the time. Requesting two or more permissions in single permission request is yet to be implemented.
